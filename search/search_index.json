They significantly influence your effectiveness in faction wars, where you might find yourself a target rather than the aggressor.</p> <p>There are four stats: Strength, Speed, Defense, and Dexterity. Each stat offers distinct advantages, so focusing on one or two at the expense of others is initially discouraged. Building up all stats to 250,000 each should be your primary goal early on. This balanced approach ensures you are well-rounded and capable in various situations. Once you achieve this milestone, you can explore more specialized strategies and delve into advanced guides to further refine your gameplay.</p> <p>The table below provides a basic overview of what each stat is used for:</p> Stat Description Strength Increases the damage you deal each hit. Defense Reduces the damage you take per hit. Speed - Increases the chance of hitting your opponent. - Decreases your opponent's chance of escaping from you. Dexterity - Increases your chance of dodging an attack. - Increases your chance of stealthing an attack. - Decreases your opponent's chance of stealthing an attack. - Increases your chance of escaping from an opponent. <p>There are several ways to boost your battle stats in Torn, with the primary methods being energy training and using army job points to target specific attributes.

Instead of waiting or using up boosters to regain happiness, a more efficient approach is to travel to Switzerland and undergo rehabilitation.
