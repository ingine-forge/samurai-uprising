Discord serves as our primary platform for operations. It's where we engage in teaching and learning, maintain constant communication, stay active, and most importantly, handle faction banking.

Simply joining the server, however, isn't sufficient because we rely on Discord bots to automate tasks. We're here to guide you through setting up and using these tools effectively. Follow the steps below to get started.


## Join Discord Servers
1. Join Samurai Uprising's Discord server using this link: [Samurai Uprising's Discord](https://discord.gg/3Y2PBSBnJk){:target="\_blank"}.

- Join Torn's Official Discord server using this link: [Torn's Official Discord](https://discord.gg/TVstvww){:target="\_blank"}.

## Torn Discord Verification
1. If you're joining Torn's server for the first time, you should see the torn bot welcome you to the server via direct message(DM).
