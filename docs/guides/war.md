## The Must-Dos in Every War

No matter the type of war, you **must**:

### 1. **Stack Your Energy**
- Always have **900 to 1000 energy** ready before war starts.
- This ensures you're prepared to attack when needed, and the faction can rely on you.

### 2. **Turn Off Your Revives**
- Do **not** let the enemy revive and re-farm you.
- Go to your settings and **disable revives** before war begins.

## Types of Wars

### 1. **Termed Wars**
- These are pre-arranged or negotiated fights with another faction.
- Usually, it's decided in advance who wins or loses, but we aim to **maximize rewards** regardless.

**Termed War Etiquette:**

- Avoid hitting **offliners**. Idlers (15+ minutes inactive) are usually okay.
- Talk to the opposing faction if you need to **med out** to speed up scoring.
---
### 2. **Un-termed (Real) Wars**
- These are full-blown wars with no agreements.
- Everything is fair game, and winning **depends entirely on us**: strategy, activity, and teamwork.

## Turtling: How to Avoid Bleeding Points

If you **can’t be online** during the war, or are underpowered compared to the opponent, your top priority is to **avoid getting farmed**.

### What Is Turtling?

Turtling means **making yourself unavailable for attacks**, usually by hospitalizing yourself or traveling. If you’re giving away more points than you’re scoring, you’re actively hurting the team. **Your first priority is to avoid being an easy target.** Don’t be that guy.

|Method|Hospital Time|Efficiency|Requirement|Medical Cooldown|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Blood Bags**|120 mins|Great|Intravenous Therapy course|30 mins|Free from faction armory|
|**Ipecac Syrup**|60–90 mins|Good alternative without the course|None|30 mins|Free from faction armory|
|**Small Explosive Device**|5 hours|Best if you're going to sleep|None|None|~6.2m (as of 07/08/25)|

### Other Options
- **Bountying or Mercing**: While technically an option, we **do not** recommend or support this, and should be avoided entirely. After a player leaves the hospital, there is a **60-second protection window** during which outside attackers (like bounty hunters or mercs) **cannot** hit them. However, the **enemy faction can** still attack you during this time, which means they will almost always get to you first. It’s expensive, unreliable, and wastes faction resources. **Stick to self-hospitalizing or traveling.**
    
- **Traveling**: A good choice if you're busy in real life. Just note that you **won’t be able to score**, and you’re **vulnerable to being camped while abroad**, as nothing can be done to help you until you return.

## War Strategy Checklist

1. **Stack 900 to 1000 energy** beforehand.
    
2. **Use Vicodin** if you're attacking. It boosts stats by 25% and has a 4 to 6-hour cooldown.
    
3. Be available at **war start** if possible.
    
4. If unavailable, **turtle** or **travel** smart.
    
5. **Coordinate** in faction chat before attacking.
    
6. **Score efficiently**, not just frequently.

7. **Be mindful of your medical cooldown during wars.**

    In real wars, if you're online and actively scoring, you're likely getting hospitalized as well, just like we're doing to their onliners. Keep an eye on your medical cooldown because it runs out faster than you think. Once it's gone, you'll be stuck waiting to heal, which means less time scoring and a lower overall contribution.

## Scoring: How to Earn More Respect

A common issue: high-stat players logging in briefly, farming weak targets, leaking points, and logging off. We appreciate your effort, but **efficiency matters more than raw activity**.

We reward players with **high average scores** during wars. Here’s how to make every hit count:

### Key Tips for High Respect:

- **Target higher-level players**. The higher the level, the better your base respect.
    
- **Join chains early**. Respect increases the deeper into the chain you are.
    
- **Use group attacks**. Hitting with teammates gives bonus respect.
    
- **Retaliate smartly**. To earn retaliation bonus, you **must hospitalize** someone who attacked us within the last 5 minutes.
    
- **Leave or hospitalize wisely**:  
    → **Leave** if the target is offline.  
    → **Hospitalize** if they’re online to prevent them from hitting back.
    
- **Always hit war targets**, unless none are available and the chain needs saving.
    
- **Go for fair fights**. Hitting targets near your stat range gives up to **3× respect**. Avoid extremely weak targets.
    

In short: **attack efficiently, not lazily**. Think before you hit. Every point matters—both what you gain and what you give away.
